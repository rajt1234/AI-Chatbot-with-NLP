# AI Chatbot with NLP
Created a fully working chatbot named as "DHRUVA" using Natural Language Processing library like 'Spacy'. It also include some AI features which are capable of answering user queries.
It is capable to take both 'Voice Command' and 'Type Command' from the users to reply their queries.
